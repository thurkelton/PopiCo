A repository for a start-up clothing website

I am a college student with a major in managemnt information systems and I'm using this site to hopefully gain some knowledge and insight on how to better create webpages and just coding in general. My main idea is to create and customize a good looking and useful website for my girlfriend's new star-up website. The website is to fucntion as an outlet for her to start selling some clothing that she has ideas for.
